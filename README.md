#Project_Name: RIS Reflection Coefficient Visualization
🎯 Objective:
Simulate and visualize how the reflection coefficient (a phase-shifted complex value) changes with frequency and incident angle in a RIS (Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface) element.

📐 Background:
In RIS, each element reflects an incoming signal with a controllable phase shift:

Γ
(
𝜃
,
𝑓
)
=
𝑒
𝑗
𝜙
(
𝜃
,
𝑓
)
Γ(θ,f)=e 
jϕ(θ,f)
 
Where:

𝜃
θ: incident angle

𝑓
f: signal frequency

𝜙
(
𝜃
,
𝑓
)
ϕ(θ,f): phase shift (we'll simulate it)

📈 OUTPUT:
A smooth 3D surface showing how the phase varies with angle and frequency — like a “phase map” of an RIS element.
